# Myo Muse Web UI
Simple Angular 2 web app that:
  - uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to let the user search and select tracks for a playlist
  - uses the [Echonest API](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4) to get precrunched audio analytics (song tempo specifically)
  - listens for gait information from the socket server and plays Spotify's 30 second sample of a song with appropriate BPM
